Description: A light weight package that collects COVID-19 data from a variety 
    of sources including John Hopkins University (JHU) and The New York Times 
    (NYT) GitHub repositories.  The JHU provides global daily totals, and 
    separate data for the US.  The NYT provides daily data at the state and 
    county levels for the US only.  Public health status by county is provided 
    by ESRI open data.  Other sources also included not listed 
    here; please reference the package down site.  All the data is in a tidy format.
